#description: final project. A program that generates a dumbell workout and keeps a workout log for the user.


#PEER REVIEW stuff:Â 
'''
Any feedback about how to maybe store and access the data more efficiently would be cool or anything that could make the program easier to 
interact with. Open to any and all suggestions.

I'm still trying to figure out how to create a new txt file if it doesn't exist already. So to run the 'view' workout log you're going
to have to create an empty workoutlog.txt file in the same folder as this (i couldn't upload a folder to the discussion post)----if you have any tips let me know!
